June temperature data was collected between 2010-2017, and December data was collected between 2010-2016. There was an additional year of data collection for the month of June however, this does not seem to have affected the comparison between the two months as the averages were still so similar. 


When comparing the statistics for the temperature data for Oahu in June and December, it can be concluded that the business would be sustainable at least between June-December as the weather does not change drastically between the summer and winter seasons.
